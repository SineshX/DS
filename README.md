# Data Structures

In this repository I'll add all of my data structures implementations. Most of them are implemented by C programming language.

If you know Hindi go to my youtube channel for tutorials on these topics: 

Enjoy! :)

### **Data Structures List:**

#### Linear Data Structure:
- [Stack - Basic Implementation](https://github.com/)
- [Stack - Parentheses Balance Checking](https://github.com)
- [Queue - Basic Implementation](https://github.com/)
- [Conversion of Infix to Postfix notation. Evaluation of Postfix notation](https://github.com/)
- [Deque – Double-Ended Queue](https://github.com/hasancse91/)
- [Singly Linked List: Create, Print and Count the Item](https://github.com)
- [Singly Linked List: Create, Insert, Search, Delete and Print operation](https://github.com/)
- [Doubly Linked List: Insert, Print the list forward and reverse order](https://github.com/)
- [Doubly Linked List: Insert, Delete, Print the list forward and reverse order](https://github.com/)
- [Circular Singly Linked List: Insert, Delete, Traverse (Print)](https://github.com/)
- [Circular Doubly Linked List: Insert, Delete, Traverse (print) Forward order and Reverse order](https://github.com/)

#### Non-Linear Data Structure:
- [Tree - Binary Search Tree - BST [Insert, Search and Traversal]](https://github.com/)
- [Tree – Binary Search Tree – BST [Find Maximum and Minimum value]](https://github.com/)
- [Tree – Binary Search Tree – BST [Delete any node of BST]](https://github.com)
- [Tree – Binary Search Tree – BST [Checking: Is it a BST or Not?]](https://github.com/)
