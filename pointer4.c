/* p3.c
The program below uses pointer arithmetic to determine the size of a 'char'
variable. By using pointer arithmetic we can find out the value of 'cp' and
the value of 'cp+1'. Since cp is a pointer, this addition involves pointer
arithmetic: adding one to a pointer makes the pointer point to the next
element of the same type.
For a pointer to a char, adding 1 really just means adding 1 to the address,
but this is only because each char is 1 byte.
1. Compile and run the program and see what it does.
2. Write some code that does pointer arithmetic with a pointer to an
int and determine how big an int is.
3. Same idea – figure out how big a double is, by using pointer
arithmetic and printing out the value of the pointer before and
after adding 1.
4. What should happen if you added 2 to the pointers from exercises
1 through 3, instead of 1? Use your program to verify your
answer.
